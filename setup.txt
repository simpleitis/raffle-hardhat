Brainstorming
1)User should be able to enter raffle by paying a min amount
2)Contract should pick a random winner
3)Winner should be picked every x minute
4)Chain link has to be used for random number and automated winner picking(chain link keepers)


Just after creating the skeleton of the contract run 'yarn hardhat compile' to check if it is compiling properly

If we are using chainlink services we need to run 'yarn add --dev @chainlink/contracts' so that we can download the .sol files from github directly to our contract

Instead of writing long commands like 'yarn hardhat .....' we can use the 'hardhat-shorthand' package by running 'yarn global add hardhat-shorthand'. Now instead of running commands like 'yarn hardhat compile' we can run 'hh compile'

After writing the smart contract(s) and compiling them, create a deploy folder and create '01-deploy-raffle.js'. Also make all the neccessary updates in 'hardhat.config.js' and '.env' file for the deploy scripts to work properly

Create 'helper-hardhat-config.js' and enter the details of the external contract used in the contract

Create a 'test' folder in 'contracts' folder and create the mock files there

Create new folder 'utils' and inside it create 'verify.js'

Create folder 'test' and create 'Raffle.test.js'

To run only specific 'it' blocks we can use 'hh test --grep "keyword(s)" 

'hh coverage' can be used to check the coverage of tests

if 'toNumber()' does not work then use 'toString()' inside assert statements

in 'hardhat.config' we can add a 'timeout' to prevent a failed transaction to result in a promise which does not get resolved or rejected

TO RUN STAGING tests
1) Get subId for chainlink verify and fund it
2) Deploy our contract using the subId
3) Register the contract with chainlink vrf and it's subId
4) Register the contract with chainlink keepers
5) Run staging tests (hh test --network goerli)
